<summary><h3>⬇️ Modularizing a Large Shiny Application <i>Observatório de Inteligência Artificial (OBIA)</i></h3></summary>

*Refactoring and hardening a production-grade Shiny application for long-term maintainability, collaboration, and reliability.*

### Overview
This project documents the refactoring of a large, production Shiny application used in a national analytics context. 

The original codebase had grown organically into a monolithic structure that was difficult to maintain, test, and extend.

The goal was to transform the application into a **modular, testable, and reproducible system**, suitable for multi-developer collaboration and continuous deployment.

### Key Contributions
- Refactored a monolithic Shiny application into a **fully modular architecture**
- Reduced total lines of code by **~41%** while improving readability and extensibility
- Introduced **automated testing**, linting, and formatting standards
- Implemented **reproducible dependency management** using `renv`
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** to ensure code quality and deployment safety
- Improved application performance and load behavior

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** R  
- **Frameworks:** Shiny, plotly
- **Testing:** testthat  
- **Reproducibility:** renv  
- **CI/CD:** GitLab CI  
- **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes  

### Results & Impact
- Significantly improved maintainability and onboarding for new contributors
- Enabled reliable multi-developer workflows
- Increased confidence in production releases through automated checks
- Established a reusable architectural pattern for future Shiny applications

### Notes
This refactor prioritizes **long-term sustainability over short-term feature additions** and serves as a reference architecture for future analytical applications.

<summary><h3>⬇️ Levelling up the team's own R package</h3></summary>

*Standardizing, hardening, and productionizing an internal R package to support reproducible analytics, CI/CD, and multi-developer collaboration.*

### Overview
When joining a new team, I inherited an internal R package used to centralize shared analytical functionality across multiple products. While the package was already in use, it lacked **standardization**, **clear role separation between users and contributors**, and a **reliable CI/CD and release process**.

The goal of this project was to transform the package into a **stable, versioned, and reproducible internal dependency**, suitable for long-term maintenance and safe use across production systems.

### Key Contributions
- Standardized package structure, formatting, and development conventions across the entire codebase  
- Introduced **CI/CD pipelines** to automate checks, builds, and versioned internal releases  
- Established a **clear separation between user-facing and contributor-facing logic and documentation**  
- Implemented **reproducible dependency management** using `renv`, compatible with multiple R versions  
- Added **unit testing** with `testthat` and enforced code quality via formatting, linting, and pre-commit hooks  
- Designed and implemented a **safe versioning strategy** to prevent breaking changes in dependent products  

### Tech Stack
- **Language:** R  
- **Package tooling:** testthat, roxygen2  
- **Reproducibility:** renv, rig  
- **Code quality:** Air (formatting), lintr (linting), pre-commit  
- **CI/CD:** GitLab CI  
- **Distribution:** pak, internal release artifacts  

### Results & Impact
- Enabled **versioned installation** of the package, allowing teams to pin stable releases and avoid regressions  
- Reduced onboarding time through clear **README** and **CONTRIBUTING** documentation  
- Established **reproducible builds** with downloadable artifacts produced by the CI pipeline  
- Improved development consistency across contributors and environments  
- Made internal analytics workflows **more reliable, scalable, and maintainable**

This work turned the package from a loosely maintained codebase into a **production-ready internal dependency**, supporting both rapid development and long-term stability.

### Notes
- Older products could safely continue using pinned package versions while new releases evolved independently  
- The separation of *users vs. contributors* clarified responsibilities and reduced friction in collaboration  
- The CI/CD setup now serves as a **reference template** for other internal R packages

## About me

Ph.D.-trained Data Scientist with 8+ years of experience in quantitative analysis, statistical modeling, and applied data science. I specialize in building reproducible analytical workflows and production-grade data applications that support data-driven decision-making.

My work combines advanced statistical and Bayesian modeling, machine learning, and software engineering practices, with hands-on experience in R, Python, SQL, CI/CD, and containerized deployments. I focus on translating complex data into actionable insights through robust analysis, interactive dashboards, and clear analytical narratives.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at CEPTRO / NIC.br, where I develop and maintain analytical systems used to understand and monitor internet usage and network quality in Brazil. I collaborate in international and interdisciplinary teams and bring strong experience working across cultural and institutional contexts.
